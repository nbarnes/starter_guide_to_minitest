starter_guide_to_minitest
=========================

This is a small presentation that describes the process of integrating a
very simple example project with Minitest, providing the ability to use
Minitest to test the project's functionality.  It also describes some simple
ways to make running tests extremely quick and easy for the developer.

Minitest is a very popular testing framework for the Ruby programming
language.  As of Ruby 1.9, it ships with Ruby as the default testing
framework and is the most popular testing framework for the very popular
Rails web development toolkit.

This presentation was written by myself, Nathaniel Barnes, and given to my
class at CodeFellow's Ruby on Rails bootcamp on Friday the 25th, October
2013.  A video of the presentation can be found at
